## Task 9 – Random Forest: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Work Done
- Analyzed class imbalance
- Applied stratified train-test split
- Trained Logistic Regression baseline
- Trained Random Forest classifier
- Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Analyzed feature importance
- Saved trained model using joblib

### Outcome
Built a robust fraud detection model suitable for imbalanced datasets.
### Dataset
The Credit Card Fraud dataset is large (~69MB) and is not uploaded to GitHub.
It can be downloaded from Kaggle:
